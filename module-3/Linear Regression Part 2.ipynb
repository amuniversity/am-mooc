    "## Linear Regression: Part 2\n",
    "----\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we learned how to build a simple linear model on our dataset. You were asked to build a linear model to predict housing prices. This exercise will be very similar but now, we will incorporate training, validation and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to give you a simple, hands-on experience with the process of training, validating and testing your data. The exercise is split up in a manner that will lead you through the entire process step-by-step starting from partitioning your data all the way to testing your generated model. This should reinforce the knowledge gained about what role each set plays in the supervised learning process. Additionally, it will give you a basic idea of problems like model and feature selection which are a common and crucial part of the supervised learning process. If you are unclear about the purpose of each dataset, go back to the Cross-Validation and Overfitting slides and review slide 4 before starting this exercise.\n",
